# setting-dashboard

It is a simple Setting-dashboard page where admin can add any team members with a fetch request and check all the team members. It is built using Material-ui. Home page and all the list item pages are blanks for now. You can go to setting to view all the team members.
Here is the deployed link - https://setting-dashboard.vercel.app/
